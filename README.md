# Learn Firebase

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) is an awesome Google product.

I'm using this repo to learn and test things using Firebase.

The code is edited on the [Google Cloud Shell](console.cloud.google.com/cloudshell). Try it yourself to be amazed!

The code just works in Google Cloud Shell environment. I will not seek compatibility problems on local setups.
